# Secure-Shell-SSH-Set-up-Hardening
This lab focuses on setting up and hardening SSH (Secure Shell) on an Ubuntu virtual machine running in VirtualBox. The goal was to configure secure remote access, enforce key-based authentication, and apply basic hardening techniques such as disabling password login and changing the default SSH port.
